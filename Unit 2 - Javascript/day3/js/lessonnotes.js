Copy day3 onto your computer
Open main.js in the /js folder in Brackets.
Starting at line 1, do the following:
    *prompt the user to enter his/her name
    *store the result in a variable called myName 
    *open blankpage.html and see what happens

students see that the page runs the code.
How is it accessing the code you wrote?
    * includes the code through the <script></script> tags
    * also runs code using <script> tags in the file itself
    
Sometimes it makes sense to have code in the page, other times it is better to include it in a separate file
    *Right now, we're going to do both. Important for now...top of the page code runs before bottom of the page code.
    
This is a bit different than when we were just typing into the console. Try pasting one of your solutions into the
main.js file.
    *You'll see that it jumbles lines of code together - we need semicolons to show the end of each statement.
    
Individual task 1:
    *get all of the code from last night's challenges into main.js. Be sure to include semicolons where you need them!

Show the confirm function as one more way to get information from the user

Introduce the idea of if-else statements.

    *is a number less than 5?
    *does your name start with an e?
    *is a name entered into a prompt the correct name?
    *input number of burgers eaten at lunch - very healthy number of burgers, a weinberg number of burgers, and too many burgers
