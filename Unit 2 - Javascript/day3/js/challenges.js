//Challenge 2
//The code below asks the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable number using parseInt(). Enter an expression inside if() below that will print out "That number is bigger than 500" if the number is more than 500, and "That number is less than 100" if it is less than or equal to 500.
/*

//Challenge 3
//The code below asks the user to enter another number and store the result in userNumber. Enter console.log commands so that the program says 'Even' if the number is even, and 'Odd' if the number is odd.

//Challenge 6
//The code below picks a random number between 1 and 10 and stores it in the variable randomNumber. Prompt the user to enter a number. If the number is equal to the randomNumber, alert "Yes! The correct number is X" where X is the value of randomNumber. Otherwise, print out "Sorry, the correct number was X", where X is the value of randomNumber.
var randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random()*10)+1;
var guess = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number between 1 and 10"));
