<h1>Mini-Project #1 - All about you!</h1>

You must create an About Me page for next class that has the following:

<ol>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>a photo</li>
<li>your grade</li>
<li>your email address</li>
<li>Five links that you use on a regular basis</li>
</ol>
    

<p></p>
You must also include a biography describing your school history. Specifically, I'd like answers to the following questions:
<ul>
    <li>What different schools have you attended, and in what places?</li>
    <li>What teacher had the greatest influence on you? Why?</li>
    <li>What are your favorite things to learn in school?</li>
    <li>What are the biggest challenges you have as a student?</li>
    <li>What do you most want to make with the knowledge you will learn in this class?</li>
</ul>
Your page should include at least one paragraph, one image, a horizontal line, five links, and two different header sizes.
<p/>
Rubric:
<table>
<tr><td>1</td><td>You submit an assignment, but it does not meet the requirements above.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>You submit an assignment that has <u>all</u> of the requirements above. It contains at least one paragraph element, five anchor/link elements, an image, two different heading types (h1, h2, ...), and a horizontal line somewhere.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You submit an assignment that has all of the above requirements. It also has no spelling mistakes and shows at least one use of styling (such as color or font).</td></tr>
