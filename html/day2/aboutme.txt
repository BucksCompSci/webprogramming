Mini-Project #1 - All about you!

You must create an About Me page that has the following:

Five links that you use on a regular basis

A biography telling your history of school. Specifically, I'd like answers to the following questions:
    *What different schools have you attended, and in what places?
    *What teacher had the greatest influence on you? Why?
    *What are your favorite things to learn in school?
    *What are the biggest challenges you have as a student?
    *What do you most want to make with the knowledge you will learn in this class?
