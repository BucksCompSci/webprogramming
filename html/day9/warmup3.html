<div>This is a div.</div>
    
<div class = "blue">This is another div, with a class of blue.</div>

<p class = "blue">This is a paragraph, also with a class of blue. You might notice there arent any style rules for paragraph tags between the style tags. Why is this one colored differently, even though it has the same class as the div?</p>
