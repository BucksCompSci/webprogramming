<h3>MileauxWeb is here for all of your web searching needs.</h3>

All you have to do is click the button:
<button class = "btn btn-primary">Click here</button>
    
</div>    
    
<div class = "col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 jumbotron">

 We can even use Bootstrap to create a box that sits in the middle of the page.
