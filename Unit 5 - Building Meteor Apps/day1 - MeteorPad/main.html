<!--

One thing to notice about the templates in this file is how they are named. 

Using Blaze, we have been doing this:
<script type = "text/spacebars" name = "main">


</script>

Meteor lets you use this:
<template name = "main">

</template> 

Much simpler. You'll need to switch these in the file below.




-->


<template name = "main">

<div class = "container text-center">
<h1>Enter your name and favorite number below.</h1>    
<input type = "text" id = "name" placeholder = "Name">    
<input type = "number" id = "number" placeholder = "Favorite Number">  
<button id = "submitButton">Submit</button>  
</div>

</template>

<script type = "text/spacebars" name = "responses">
<div id = "responses">
Here are the responses to the survey:
{{#each response}}
{{>responseItem}}
{{/each}}

</div>
</script>

<script type = "text/spacebars" name = "responseItem">
<div class = "responseItem">

{{name}}'s favorite number is <span class = "green">{{number}}</span>. This number squared is <span class = "green">{{numberSquared}}</span>.

</div>

</script>
