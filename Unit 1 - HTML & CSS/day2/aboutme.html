    <h1>Mini-Project #1 - All about you!</h1>

    You must create an About Me page for next class that has the following:

    <ol>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>a photo</li>
        <li>your grade</li>
        <li>your email address</li>
        <li>Five links that you use on a regular basis</li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>You must also include a biography describing your school history. Specifically, I'd like answers to the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have you attended different schools? Where?</li>
        <li>What teacher had the greatest influence on you? Why?</li>
        <li>What are your favorite things to learn in school?</li>
        <li>What are the biggest challenges you have as a student?</li>
        <li>What do you most want to make with the knowledge you will learn in this class?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your page should include at least one paragraph, one image, a horizontal line, five links, and two different header sizes.</p>
    
    <p>Rubric:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>You submit an assignment, but it does not meet the requirements above.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>You submit an assignment that has <u>all</u> of the requirements above. It contains at least one paragraph element, five anchor/link elements, an image, two different heading types (h1, h2, ...), and a horizontal line somewhere.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>You submit an assignment that has all of the above requirements. It also has no spelling mistakes and shows at least one use of styling (such as color or font).</td></tr>
    </table>
