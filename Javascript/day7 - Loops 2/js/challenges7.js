//Challenge : You're going to create a simple game called 'Fizz-Buzz', which we played in class. This starts with the number 1. 
//If the number is a multiple of 3, you should say 'Fizz'. 
//If the number is a multiple of 5, you should say 'Buzz'. 
//If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you should say 'Fizz-Buzz'. 
//Otherwise, just say the number. 
//The number increases by 1 with the next person.
//The correct sequence of responses for the first fifteen numbers is:
//1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz,11,Fizz,13,14,Fizz-Buzz.
//Create a for loop that generates these values for the numbers 1 - 30. This will you require to use an if/else structure, the % operator, and either && or || operators.
